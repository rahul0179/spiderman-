                        In a nutshell, Spider-Man represents the reverse of almost every other superhero's “secret
                        identity” concept. Most superheroes are defined as “they look like normal people in everyday
                        life, but secretly they are superheros.” The distinction is how their normal appearances are
                        contrary to the reality of who they are.May 8, 2014

                        Peter Benjamin Parker is a former high school student who gained spider-like abilities, fighting
                        crime
                        across New York City as the superhero Spider-Man. While Parker juggled all his continued hero
                        duties
                        with the demands of his high-school life, he was approached by Tony Stark who recruited
                        Spider-Man
                        to
                        join the Avengers Civil War, putting Spider-Man into the brief conflict with his personal hero,
                        Captain
                        America. Parker was given a new suit as well as new Stark technology in exchange for his help,
                        allowing
                        him to return back home to continue his own hero work.
